I am a french django developer living in London now.

Few months ago, I was depressed being a well paid consultant working in financial institution. He took me 4 years to notice I was not made to work for money but for passion.

Does that exist, people working for passion?

As a passionate django developer for 4 years now, stubbing websites, creating new personnal projects, programming on a weekly basis outside work, I may try to find a job where people will pay for me to do that, on a daily basis.

Direction the best place for a django job in Europe: London.

What a city. So many stuff to do, so many different cultures, we do love it.

Then, why do you want to live if you love it? If the first city is that cool, there should be plenty of other as cool. 

We want to see them all, from inside, as an inhabitant, as a worker.

Berlin, Barcelone, New York, Vancouver, Melbourne, Taiwan, Tokyo, Rome... All of them

Well, all is a lot! What about once every 2 months? Short. Every 6 months? Long. 3 months? GO.

How long? 24 months then 8 countries. GO.

For what to do? Mainly Python and/or Django. But not only. I am passionate about python, not extrimist.

24 months, 8 countries, 1 language. A project is born.
