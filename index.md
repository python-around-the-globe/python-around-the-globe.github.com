  Work in a different country every 3 months with the best python/django developer around the world as a [ put here whichever contract type would suit you best ] for a [ put the average rate in your country].
  Project start after the DjangoCon Europe.

##The long story

- Monday,  16th july **2007**: First work day of my life
- Wednesday,  10th july **2008**: Year 1. Bored
- Monday,  11th april **2011**: 269 days past year 3. Still bored. I have to change.

My job was not uninteresting. As any jobs, there is still tons of challenges to be achieved. My concern was quality. How to bring more quality in all processes I was involved in. I get some strong successes and some deep failures.

**meanwhile in another life...**

I was practising programming for my own projects and became a python addict.

The gap between what you may achieve at home and all the efforts you have to do to achieve a simple task at work was deeply growing.

Two main reasons: Technologies and processes.

Heavy processes with unsuitable technologies lead to a slow velocity. Doing same tasks again and again, patching same issues, again and again.

##From passion to Passion

Being unable to find any python jobs in Luxembourg, I started to look after relocation. After having performed a huge market study on where to find python/django devs around the world (Thanks to Djangogigs), my girlfriend and I decided to move in the UK \*.

I have been welcomed by TangentLabs, where I grew from passionate programmer to professional programmer. You know what, I do like it. Happy to have done the right choice.

My concern was still quality and I enjoyed the fact all my team embraced the comeback to TDD which had just been forgot for a few months. My project contained around 30 tests when I joined and is now 270 tests exactly.

I did learn a lot from all my colleagues but I now reached the zone of comfort. Time to live again.

##Are you the next? 

The project took a crazy shape. We like to travel and I like python/django. Let’s do both!
Like a initiatory travel, meeting plenty of new peoples, sharing knowledge, learning new tools, new techs. Only two rules: using python and moving to a different country each time. Doing that again, and again. Every 3 months. For 24 months ie:

24 months - 8 countries - 1 language

Are you next ?


\* UK was the second choice after the US, for sure, but it really seems than US government doesn’t want us. Next step maybe.
